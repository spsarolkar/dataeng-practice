🧪 Core Java / Collections
1. 🔁 LRU Cache (Least Recently Used)
Design a cache using LinkedHashMap or Deque + HashMap.

✅ Practice: Map, Queue, Eviction policy, Concurrency control (optional)

2. 🔢 Custom Comparator Sort
Sort a list of Employee objects by age, and then by name.

java
Copy
Edit
List<Employee> list = ...
list.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getAge).thenComparing(Employee::getName));
✅ Practice: Lambdas, functional interfaces

3. 🌐 Anagram Grouping
Given a list of strings, group anagrams together. Input: ["cat", "tac", "bat", "tab", "act"] → Output: [[cat, tac, act], [bat, tab]]

✅ Practice: Map<String, List<String>>, sorting, hashing

4. ⛓️ Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm.

✅ Practice: Pointers, edge cases

5. 🧠 Thread-safe Counter
Implement a thread-safe Counter with methods: increment(), get().

✅ Practice: AtomicInteger, synchronized, ReentrantLock

⚙️ Concurrency / Multithreading
6. 🚦 Print Even/Odd with Two Threads
One thread prints even numbers, the other prints odd — in sequence.

✅ Practice: wait() / notify(), thread coordination

7. 🔄 Producer-Consumer
Use BlockingQueue to implement producer-consumer pattern with threads.

✅ Practice: Concurrency utilities, race conditions

8. 🧵 Deadlock Detection or Resolution
Write code that triggers deadlock with 2 threads & then resolve it.

⚡ Spark / Streaming Coding
9. 🔥 Sliding Window Aggregation
Given a stream of transactions, find total spend per user over a sliding 10-minute window.

✅ Practice: withWatermark, window, groupByKey, custom state

10. 🛰️ Stateful Login Pattern Detection
Detect if a user logs in from multiple IPs in 1 minute using flatMapGroupsWithState.

11. 🧹 Custom Partitioning in RDD
Implement your own Partitioner to route data by even/odd key.

✅ Practice: Spark RDD API, reduceByKey, partitionBy

🧠 Bonus — Puzzles & Logic
12. 💡 Missing Number
Find the missing number in a range 1...n from an array of size n−1.

13. 💡 Palindrome Permutation
Check if any permutation of a string is a palindrome (e.g., "tactcoa" → "taco cat")
