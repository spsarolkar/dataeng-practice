---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





✅ Java 9
1. 🔐 Factory Methods for Collections
New static methods on interfaces like List, Set, and Map for immutable collections.

java
Copy
Edit
List<String> list = List.of("A", "B", "C");
Set<Integer> set = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
Map<String, Integer> map = Map.of("A", 1, "B", 2);
Immutable by default

Throws UnsupportedOperationException on mutation attempts

2. 🔄 Map.ofEntries(...)
For maps with more than 10 key-value pairs:

java
Copy
Edit
Map<String, String> map = Map.ofEntries(
    Map.entry("key1", "val1"),
    Map.entry("key2", "val2")
);
✅ Java 10
3. 💡 copyOf() Methods
Creates unmodifiable copies from existing collections.

java
Copy
Edit
List<String> copy = List.copyOf(existingList);
If the original list is already unmodifiable, no copy is made.

Great for defensive copying in APIs.

✅ Java 11
4. 🚀 Performance Improvements
Internally optimized collection factories (e.g., List.of) for better memory usage and iteration speed.

✅ Java 12
5. 🧪 Collectors.teeing() — Advanced Stream Aggregation
Combines two downstream collectors and merges the results.

java
Copy
Edit
var result = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    .collect(Collectors.teeing(
        Collectors.summingInt(i -> i),
        Collectors.counting(),
        (sum, count) -> sum / count
    ));
➡ Calculates average manually
🧠 Powerful when .averagingInt() doesn’t fit complex logic.

✅ Java 14–17
6. 📈 Internal Optimizations
JDK team has continued improving spliterator, parallel stream, and ConcurrentHashMap internals for performance and lower GC pressure.

7. 📁 toList() on Stream (Java 16+)
Simpler and more readable:

java
Copy
Edit
List<String> list = stream.toList(); // Instead of collect(Collectors.toList())
🧠 Interview-Ready Summary

Version	Feature
Java 9	List.of(), Set.of(), Map.of(), Map.ofEntries()
Java 10	copyOf() methods
Java 12	Collectors.teeing()
Java 16	Stream.toList()
Java 9–17	Many internal enhancements for performance and memory efficiency
