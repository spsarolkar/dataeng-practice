common interview favorite, and knowing how to differentiate RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset clearly (especially from a Java developer's perspective) can really impress.

🔍 Difference Between RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset in Spark
Feature	RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)	DataFrame	Dataset
Type Safety	✅ Yes (Compile-time type checks)	❌ No (Untyped, like a SQL table)	✅ Yes (only in Scala/Java)
API Level	Low-level Functional (Java/Scala)	High-level Relational API	Mid-level (Mix of both)
Performance	❌ Slower (No optimization)	✅ Faster (Catalyst + Tungsten)	✅ Faster (Catalyst + Tungsten)
Ease of Use	❌ Verbose in Java	✅ Easy SQL-like syntax	Moderate (needs Encoders)
Serialization	Java Serialization (Slower)	Tungsten binary format	Encoders for optimized serialization
Use Case	Complex transformations, custom logic	Structured data, SQL queries	Structured data with type safety
